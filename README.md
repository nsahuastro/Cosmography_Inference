This repository provides a python notebook (cosmology_using_Beta12_wCDM.ipynb ) for 
1- inferring cosmological parameters using distance ratio obtained from lens modeling 
2- joint constraints with other independent lensing studies
3- joint constraints with other classical probes of cosmology.

The code is reads mcmc chain obtained from lens modeling and
1- predicts/infers cosmological parameters using Beta_12 for two paradiagms Lambda CDM and wCDM
2- Obtains Probability distribution function of individual and joint constraints 
3- Generates 2D probability density plots 
4- Calculats joint probability density combining AGEL1507 inference with constraints from other independent studies such Collett+14, SNe, BAO, and Planck.
5- 1D and 2D probability distribution plots.

Please cite Sahu et al. (2025, https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00656) is you use the code or data form this repository.
