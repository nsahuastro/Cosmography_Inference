This project is in preparation...

This repository provides a code for 
1- extracting cosmology using distance ratio obtained from lens modeling using mcmc
2- joint constraints with other independent lensing studies
3- joint constraints with other classical probes of cosmology.

The code is build upon the mcmc cosmology code by Pierre.

Nandini Sahu added the following
1- Probability distribution function of individual and joint constraints 
2- 2D probability density plots and joint constraints from independent studies 
3- 1D and 2D distribution plots.

The current constraints are for the LCDM model and wCDM only, but I plan to add constraints for other general cosmological models as well.

Please credit Pierre and Nandini if you are using this code. Thank you
